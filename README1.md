Penalty regular term default l2 then none is l2



L1_ratio elasticnet parameter default 0.15



Multiply the alpha constant by the regularization term


Max_iter maximum number of iterations


Random_state random seed It is recommended to remove this feature


N_jobs cpu number to the number of 4 core


N_samples sample size


N_features number of features


N_classes tag number


N_clusters_per_class number of clusters per class


Number of n_informative information functions


The sample score of the flip_y level random exchange. The larger the value, the harder it is to classify the task. The longer it takes time.


Scale Scale Multiplies the feature by the specified value. If None, the feature is scaled by the random value drawn in [1,100]. Please note that scaling will occur after shifting.
